# MultiversoDigital - TikTok Direct Post Manager

**MultiversoDigital** is a robust administrative tool developed in Flutter for Windows, designed for media asset management and **Direct Post** publishing to TikTok.

## 🚀 Project Purpose
This application is a private tool that allows the app owner to publish curated video content directly to authorized TikTok profiles, ensuring total control over content workflow and brand integrity.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications and Robustness
Following our **"Iron Law"** of development, this project prioritizes:
- **Total Stability:** Code is designed to be immune to crashes and silent errors.
- **Secure Persistence:** Uses Hive for local token storage with automatic box reconstruction in case of corruption.
- **Optimized Interface:** Features protected scrolling and full visibility, adapted to prevent overflows on Windows devices.
- **Internationalization:** All messages, titles, and buttons use translation keys (l10n), avoiding hardcoded strings.

## 🔐 TikTok API Integration
The app integrates the following TikTok for Developers products:
- **Login Kit:** Secure authentication via OAuth 2.0.
- **Content Posting API:** For binary upload and direct publishing (scopes: `video.upload` and `video.publish`).
